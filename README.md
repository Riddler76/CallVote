# CallVote
Rocket plugin for Unturned to vote for things to happen

Current votes:
- Day
- Night
- (Start/Stop) Rain
- Airdrop (random on map)
- Airdropall (random but at every player's spot)
- Healall (heal everyone)
- Vehicleall (random vanilla vehicle for everyone)
- Kick <playername> (kick someone)
- Custom <Text> (does nothing)

All votes can be enabled/disabled in config and require the permission cvote and cvote.<vote>

Any suggestions?
