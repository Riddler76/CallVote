# CallVote
Rocket plugin for Unturned to vote for things to happen

Current votes:

- Night
- Rain (start/stop)
- Airdrop (random on map)
- Airdropall (random but at every player's spot)
- Healall (heal everyone)
- Vehicleall (random vanilla vehicle for everyone)
- Kick (Player) (kick someone)

All votes can be enabled/disabled in config and require the permission cvote and cvote.[vote]

Any suggestions?
