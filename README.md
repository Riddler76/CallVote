# CallVote
Rocket plugin for Unturned to vote for things to happen

Current features:
- Vote to make it day/night/(stop)rain/airdrop
- Config to change color or disable specific votes
- Translation file to change the messages

Planned features:
- Fixing the percent shown (request a pull if you could help with it)
- Make the command show all kind of votes
- Add permissions for each vote

Any suggestions?
